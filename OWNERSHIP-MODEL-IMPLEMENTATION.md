# OSKO Ownership Model Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of proper Kubernetes ownership model for OSKO resources, completed in the `fix/ownership-model` branch. The changes ensure proper resource lifecycle management, cascading deletion, and clear separation between owned and referenced resources.

## Problem Solved

### Before (Issues)
- ❌ No clear ownership semantics between SLO and related resources
- ❌ Potential resource leaks when SLOs were deleted
- ❌ Inconsistent cascading deletion behavior
- ❌ Risk of accidentally deleting shared infrastructure
- ❌ No finalizer handling for external resource cleanup
- ❌ Inline SLIs not properly managed as owned resources

### After (Solutions)
- ✅ Clear ownership model with proper OwnerReferences
- ✅ Automatic cascading deletion via Kubernetes garbage collection
- ✅ Preserved shared infrastructure (Datasources, referenced SLIs)
- ✅ Finalizer-based cleanup for external systems
- ✅ Proper inline SLI creation and ownership
- ✅ AlertManagerConfig creation for magic alerting

## Implementation Changes

### 1. SLO Controller Enhancements (`slo_controller.go`)

#### Added Constants
```go
const (
    sloFinalizer = "finalizer.slo.osko.dev"
    // ... existing constants
)
```

#### New Functionality
- **Finalizer Management**: Automatically adds/removes SLO finalizer
- **Inline SLI Creation**: Creates and owns SLI resources when `spec.indicator` is used
- **Owner Reference Setting**: Sets proper owner references on all created resources
- **AlertManagerConfig Creation**: Creates alert routing for magic alerting
- **Deletion Handling**: Proper cleanup before resource deletion

#### Key Methods Added
```go
func (r *SLOReconciler) createOrUpdateInlineSLI(ctx context.Context, slo *openslov1.SLO) (*openslov1.SLI, error)
func (r *SLOReconciler) createAlertManagerConfig(ctx context.Context, slo *openslov1.SLO, ds *openslov1.Datasource) (*oskov1alpha1.AlertManagerConfig, error)
func (r *SLOReconciler) cleanupSLOResources(ctx context.Context, slo *openslov1.SLO) error
```

### 2. Enhanced RBAC Permissions

Added required permissions for the new functionality:

```yaml
# SLI management for inline SLIs
- apiGroups: ["openslo.com"]
  resources: ["slis"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]

# AlertManagerConfig management
- apiGroups: ["osko.dev"]
  resources: ["alertmanagerconfigs"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]

# Finalizer management
- apiGroups: ["openslo.com"]
  resources: ["slos/finalizers"]
  verbs: ["update"]
```

### 3. Controller Manager Setup

Updated controller setup to own new resource types:

```go
Owns(&openslov1.SLI{}).                   // Own inline SLIs
Owns(&oskov1alpha1.AlertManagerConfig{}). // Own AlertManagerConfigs
```

## Ownership Model

### Resources OWNED by SLO (Cascading Deletion)

| Resource | When Created | Purpose |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| `SLI` | `spec.indicator` present | SLO-specific service level indicator |
| `PrometheusRule` | Always | SLO monitoring rules |
| `MimirRule` | Always | Mimir-specific rules |
| `AlertManagerConfig` | `osko.dev/magicAlerting: "true"` | SLO-specific alert routing |

### Resources REFERENCED by SLO (Preserved)

| Resource | Reference Method | Reason |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| `Datasource` | `osko.dev/datasourceRef` annotation | Shared infrastructure |
| `SLI` | `spec.indicatorRef` | May be shared by multiple SLOs |
| `AlertPolicy` | Direct reference | Shared alerting policies |

## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: SLO with Inline SLI
```yaml
apiVersion: openslo.com/v1
kind: SLO
metadata:
  name: my-slo
  annotations:
    osko.dev/datasourceRef: "shared-datasource"
spec:
  indicator:  # Inline SLI - WILL BE OWNED
    metadata:
      name: my-specific-sli
    spec:
      description: "My SLI"
      # ... SLI spec
```

**Ownership**: SLO owns PrometheusRule, MimirRule, and the created inline SLI.

### Pattern 2: SLO with Referenced SLI
```yaml
apiVersion: openslo.com/v1
kind: SLO
metadata:
  name: my-slo
  annotations:
    osko.dev/datasourceRef: "shared-datasource"
spec:
  indicatorRef: "shared-sli"  # Referenced SLI - NOT OWNED
```

**Ownership**: SLO owns PrometheusRule, MimirRule. Does NOT own the referenced SLI.

### Pattern 3: SLO with Magic Alerting
```yaml
apiVersion: openslo.com/v1
kind: SLO
metadata:
  name: my-slo
  annotations:
    osko.dev/datasourceRef: "shared-datasource"
    osko.dev/magicAlerting: "true"  # Enables AlertManagerConfig creation
spec:
  # ... rest of spec
```

**Ownership**: SLO owns PrometheusRule, MimirRule, and AlertManagerConfig.

### 🔄 Testing Required (Manual Validation)

#### Test 1: Inline SLI Ownership
```bash
# Apply SLO with inline SLI
kubectl apply -f examples/ownership-model-demo.yaml

# Verify SLI is created and owned
kubectl get sli -n monitoring
kubectl describe sli payment-success-sli -n monitoring | grep -A 5 "Owner References"

# Delete SLO and verify SLI is also deleted
kubectl delete slo payment-service-slo -n monitoring
kubectl get sli payment-success-sli -n monitoring  # Should be NotFound
```

#### Test 2: Referenced SLI Preservation
```bash
# Apply shared SLI and SLO that references it
kubectl apply -f examples/ownership-model-demo.yaml

# Verify referenced SLI exists and is NOT owned by SLO
kubectl describe sli http-success-rate-sli -n monitoring | grep -A 5 "Owner References"

# Delete SLO and verify referenced SLI remains
kubectl delete slo api-availability-slo -n monitoring
kubectl get sli http-success-rate-sli -n monitoring  # Should still exist
```

#### Test 3: AlertManagerConfig Creation
```bash
# Apply SLO with magic alerting
kubectl apply -f examples/ownership-model-demo.yaml

# Verify AlertManagerConfig is created and owned
kubectl get alertmanagerconfig -n monitoring
kubectl describe alertmanagerconfig payment-service-slo-alerting -n monitoring | grep -A 5 "Owner References"

# Delete SLO and verify AlertManagerConfig is also deleted
kubectl delete slo payment-service-slo -n monitoring
kubectl get alertmanagerconfig payment-service-slo-alerting -n monitoring  # Should be NotFound
```

#### Test 4: Shared Infrastructure Preservation
```bash
# Apply complete demo
kubectl apply -f examples/ownership-model-demo.yaml

# Delete all SLOs
kubectl delete slo --all -n monitoring

# Verify shared infrastructure remains
kubectl get datasource -n monitoring  # Should still exist
kubectl get sli http-success-rate-sli -n monitoring  # Should still exist
```

## Migration Notes

### From Previous Versions

1. **Backup Existing Resources**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get slo,sli,prometheusrule,mimirrule -o yaml > backup-before-upgrade.yaml
   ```

2. **Deploy New Version**:
   - The controller will automatically add finalizers to existing SLOs
   - Existing resources will be reconciled with proper owner references

3. **Verify Upgrade**:
   ```bash
   # Check that finalizers are added
   kubectl get slo -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}: {.metadata.finalizers}{"\n"}{end}'

   # Check that owner references are set
   kubectl get prometheusrule -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}: {.metadata.ownerReferences[*].name}{"\n"}{end}'
   ```

### Breaking Changes
- **None**: This implementation is backward compatible
- Existing SLOs will continue to work and will be enhanced with proper ownership on next reconciliation

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Creation
- Minimal additional API calls (1-2 per SLO for inline SLI/AlertManagerConfig creation)
- Owner reference setting happens synchronously during resource creation

### Memory Usage
- No significant memory impact
- Standard Kubernetes garbage collection handles owned resource cleanup

### Controller Reconciliation
- Additional logic adds minimal processing time
- Finalizer handling only occurs during deletion

## Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- SLO reconciliation errors
- Finalizer removal failures
- Owner reference setting failures

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check SLO finalizers
kubectl get slo <slo-name> -o jsonpath='{.metadata.finalizers}'

# Check owned resource owner references
kubectl get prometheusrule <slo-name> -o jsonpath='{.metadata.ownerReferences}'

# Check controller logs for ownership issues
kubectl logs -n osko-system deployment/osko-controller-manager | grep -i "owner\|finalizer"
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Cross-namespace resource references
- Soft deletion with retention policies
- Ownership validation webhooks
- Advanced cleanup strategies for external systems

### Technical Debt
- Integration tests require full Kubernetes test environment
- External system cleanup (Mimir, AlertManager) needs actual client implementations
- Error handling could be more granular for specific ownership scenarios

## Conclusion

The ownership model implementation provides:

1. **Clear Resource Lifecycle Management**: Proper creation, ownership, and deletion
2. **Kubernetes-Native Behavior**: Uses standard OwnerReferences and finalizers
3. **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing functionality
4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear usage patterns and troubleshooting guides

The implementation follows Kubernetes best practices and provides a solid foundation for reliable SLO resource management in production environments.
