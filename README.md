# osko - OpenSLO Kubernetes Operator

This operator aims to provide it's users with simple management of SLIs, SLOs, alerting rules and alerts routing via Kubernetes CRDs according to the (not only) the [OpenSLO](https://github.com/OpenSLO/OpenSLO) specification (currently `v1`).

See the [design document](DESIGN.md) for more details on what `osko` aims to do.

## Test It Out

1. Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
   - refer to the [Installation and usage](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind#installation-and-usage) section of the [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) README to use KIND.

**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

2. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

3. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

#### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

More information can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)
