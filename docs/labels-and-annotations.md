# Labels and annotations

OSKO resources often use labels and annotations for configuring different behaviors for different
OpenSLO types. This is the documentation of the available labels and annotations that you can use
and what they are used for.

## Labels

### `labels.osko.dev/<key>`

Enables labeling of Prometheus recording and alerting rules, for example for alert routing purposes.

```yaml
labels.osko.dev/team: "infrastructure"
```

## Annotations

### `osko.dev/datasourceRef`

Configures which Datasource to use in an SLO definition.

Accepts a name of the Datasource as string.

```yaml
osko.dev/datasourceRef: "mimir-infra-ds"
```

### `osko.dev/baseWindow`

Configures the base window for an individual SLO (instead of the default of "5m" specified in the config).

Accepts a string in the [time.Duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Duration) format.

```yaml
osko.dev/baseWindow: "30m"
```
